# ClockJS
A clean and simple modern take on a clock and calendar. The rings around the time represent (from outside in) hours, minutes, and seconds, with the exact time displayed in the center. The boxes to the left are a simple calendar, with the number of boxes displayed representing the current month and the number in the filled box being the date.
